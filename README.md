The goal of this project is to be able to predict the salary of sotware engineers after being given the following input characteristics:
  1. Country
  2. Education Level
  3. Experience (Years)
With all inputs satified, a machine learning module is used with historical data to predict the salary based on the given inputs
After this model was created, Streamlit was used to deploy the app into local production
